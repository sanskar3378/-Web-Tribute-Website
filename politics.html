          <h2>Political Career</h2>
          <p>
            In 1935, Ambedkar was appointed principal of the Government Law
            College, Bombay, a position he held for two years. He also served as
            the chairman of Governing body of Ramjas College, University of
            Delhi, after the death of its Founder Shri Rai Kedarnath.[48]
            Settling in Bombay (today called Mumbai), Ambedkar oversaw the
            construction of a house, and stocked his personal library with more
            than 50,000 books.[49] His wife Ramabai died after a long illness
            the same year. It had been her long-standing wish to go on a
            pilgrimage to Pandharpur, but Ambedkar had refused to let her go,
            telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead of
            Hinduism's Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables. At the
            Yeola Conversion Conference on 13 October in Nasik, Ambedkar
            announced his intention to convert to a different religion and
            exhorted his followers to leave Hinduism.[49] He would repeat his
            message at many public meetings across India. In 1936, Ambedkar
            founded the Independent Labour Party, which contested the 1937
            Bombay election to the Central Legislative Assembly for the 13
            reserved and 4 general seats, and secured 11 and 3 seats
            respectively.[50] Ambedkar published his book Annihilation of Caste
            on 15 May 1936.[51] It strongly criticised Hindu orthodox religious
            leaders and the caste system in general,[52] and included "a rebuke
            of Gandhi" on the subject.[53] Later, in a 1955 BBC interview, he
            accused Gandhi of writing in opposition of the caste system in
            English language papers while writing in support of it in Gujarati
            language papers.[54] In his writings, Ambedkar also accused
            Jawaharlal Nehru of being "conscious of the fact that he is a
            Brahmin".[55] During this time, Ambedkar also fought against the
            khoti system prevalent in Konkan, where khots, or government revenue
            collectors, regularly exploited farmers and tenants. In 1937,
            Ambedkar tabled a bill in the Bombay Legislative Assembly aimed at
            abolishing the khoti system by creating a direct relationship
            between government and farmers.[56] Ambedkar served on the Defence
            Advisory Committee[57] and the Viceroy's Executive Council as
            minister of labour.[57] Before the Day of Deliverance events,
            Ambedkar stated that he was interested in participating: "I read Mr.
            Jinnah's statement and I felt ashamed to have allowed him to steal a
            march over me and rob me of the language and the sentiment which I,
            more than Mr. Jinnah, was entitled to use." He went on to suggest
            that the communities he worked with were twenty times more oppressed
            by Congress policies than were Indian Muslims; he clarified that he
            was criticizing Congress, and not all Hindus.[58] Jinnah and
            Ambedkar jointly addressed the heavily attended Day of Deliverance
            event in Bhindi Bazaar, Bombay, where both expressed "fiery"
            criticisms of the Congress party, and according to one observer,
            suggested that Islam and Hinduism were irreconcilable.[58][59] After
            the Lahore resolution (1940) of the Muslim League demanding
            Pakistan, Ambedkar wrote a 400-page tract titled Thoughts on
            Pakistan, which analysed the concept of "Pakistan" in all its
            aspects. Ambedkar argued that the Hindus should concede Pakistan to
            the Muslims. He proposed that the provincial boundaries of Punjab
            and Bengal should be redrawn to separate the Muslim and non-Muslim
            majority parts. He thought the Muslims could have no objection to
            redrawing provincial boundaries. If they did, they did not quite
            "understand the nature of their own demand". Scholar Venkat
            Dhulipala states that Thoughts on Pakistan "rocked Indian politics
            for a decade". It determined the course of dialogue between the
            Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, paving the way for
            the Partition of India.[60][61] In his work Who Were the Shudras?,
            Ambedkar tried to explain the formation of untouchables. He saw
            Shudras and Ati Shudras who form the lowest caste in the ritual
            hierarchy of the caste system, as separate from Untouchables.
            Ambedkar oversaw the transformation of his political party into the
            Scheduled Castes Federation. It did not fare well in the 1946
            provincial elections, but in Bengal, it managed to elect Ambedkar to
            the Constituent Assembly of India by winning support from Congress
            legislators.[62][63] Jagjivan Ram's wife Indrani Jagjivan Ram wrote
            in her memoir that Ambedkar persuaded her husband to ask Mahatma
            Gandhi for his inclusion in Nehru's cabinet in independent India.
            Initially, Jagjivan Ram consulted Vallabhbhai Patel before asking
            Gandhi to recommend Ambedkar to Nehru for inclusion in cabinet,
            adding that Ambedkar had "given up his antagonism to Congress and
            Gandhiji". Ambedkar was ultimately included as the law minister of
            India in the First Nehru ministry after Gandhi recommended his name
            to Nehru.[64][65] On 27 September, 1951, Ambedkar resigned from
            Nehru's cabinet ministry after Hindu code bill was defeated in
            parliament.[66] Ambedkar contested in the Bombay North first Indian
            General Election of 1952, but lost to his former assistant and
            Congress Party candidate Narayan Sadoba Kajrolkar. Ambedkar became a
            member of Rajya Sabha, probably an appointed member. He tried to
            enter Lok Sabha again in the by-election of 1954 from Bhandara, but
            he placed third (the Congress Party won). By the time of the second
            general election in 1957, Ambedkar had died. Ambedkar also
            criticised Islamic practice in South Asia. While justifying the
            Partition of India, he condemned child marriage and the mistreatment
            of women in Muslim society. No words can adequately express the
            great and many evils of polygamy and concubinage, and especially as
            a source of misery to a Muslim woman. Take the caste system.
            Everybody infers that Islam must be free from slavery and caste.
            [...] [While slavery existed], much of its support was derived from
            Islam and Islamic countries. While the prescriptions by the Prophet
            regarding the just and humane treatment of slaves contained in the
            Koran are praiseworthy, there is nothing whatever in Islam that
            lends support to the abolition of this curse. But if slavery has
            gone, caste among Musalmans [Muslims] has remained.[67]
