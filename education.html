            In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the
            only untouchable enrolled at Elphinstone High School. In 1906, when
            he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai.
            The match was arranged by the couple's parents, in accordance with
            prevailing custom at that time.[20] In 1907, he passed his
            matriculation examination and in the following year he entered
            Elphinstone College, which was affiliated to the University of
            Bombay, becoming, according to him, the first from his Mahar caste
            to do so. When he passed his English fourth standard examinations,
            the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they
            considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was
            "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other
            communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his
            success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was
            presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the
            author and a family friend.[21] By 1912, he obtained his degree in
            economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared
            to take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had
            just moved his young family and started work when he had to quickly
            return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February
            1913.[22] Ambedkar at Columbia University, c. 1916 In 1913, at the
            age of 22, Ambedkar was awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50
            (Sterling) per month for three years under a scheme established by
            Sayajirao Gaekwad III (Gaekwad of Baroda) that was designed to
            provide opportunities for postgraduate education at Columbia
            University in New York City. Soon after arriving there he settled in
            rooms at Livingston Hall with Naval Bhathena, a Parsi who was to be
            a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in
            economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and
            Anthropology. He presented a thesis, Ancient Indian Commerce.
            Ambedkar was influenced by John Dewey and his work on democracy.[23]
            In 1916, he completed his second master's thesis, National Dividend
            of India – A Historic and Analytical Study, for a second M.A.[24] On
            9 May, he presented the paper Castes in India: Their Mechanism,
            Genesis and Development before a seminar conducted by the
            anthropologist Alexander Goldenweiser. Ambedkar received his Ph.D.
            degree in economics at Columbia in 1927.[3] Ambedkar (In center
            line, first from right) with his professors and friends from the
            London School of Economics (1916–17) In October 1916, he enrolled
            for the Bar course at Gray's Inn, and at the same time enrolled at
            the London School of Economics where he started working on a
            doctoral thesis. In June 1917, he returned to India because his
            scholarship from Baroda ended. His book collection was dispatched on
            a different ship from the one he was on, and that ship was torpedoed
            and sunk by a German submarine.[22] He got permission to return to
            London to submit his thesis within four years. He returned at the
            first opportunity, and completed a master's degree in 1921. His
            thesis was on "The problem of the rupee: Its origin and its
            solution".[25] In 1923, he completed a D.Sc. in Economics which was
            awarded from University of London, and the same year he was called
            to the Bar by Gray's Inn.[3]
