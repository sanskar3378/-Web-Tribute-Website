          <h2>The father of Indian Constitution</h2>
          <p>
            Dr. B. R. Ambedkar was a prominent Indian jurist, economist, and
            social reformer who played a pivotal role in advocating for the
            rights of the marginalized communities, particularly the Dalits
            (formerly known as untouchables). Born into a Dalit family, he faced
            discrimination and social exclusion, which fueled his commitment to
            fight against caste-based discrimination. Ambedkar was the principal
            architect of the Indian Constitution and chaired the drafting
            committee, contributing significantly to its formation, ensuring it
            reflected principles of social justice, equality, and fundamental
            rights for all citizens. He also advocated for women's rights and
            education as crucial tools for societal transformation. His efforts
            led to the abolition of untouchability and the promotion of social
            equality through his work in law, education, and social movements.
            He embraced Buddhism towards the later years of his life,
            encouraging millions of Dalits to follow suit as a means of
            rejecting the caste system. Ambedkar's legacy remains deeply
            influential in India's socio-political landscape, revered as the
            father of the Indian Constitution and a champion of social justice.
            He continues to inspire movements for equality and inclusion
            worldwide.

          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military
            cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar) (now
            in Madhya Pradesh). He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji
            Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of Subedar, and Bhimabai
            Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar. His family was of Marathi
            background from the town of Ambadawe (Mandangad taluka) in Ratnagiri
            district of modern-day Maharashtra. Ambedkar was born into a Mahar
            (dalit) caste, who were treated as untouchables and subjected to
            socio-economic discrimination. Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked
            for the army of the British East India Company, and his father
            served in the British Indian Army at the Mhow cantonment. Although
            they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were
            segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were
            not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink
            water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a
            height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the
            vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the
            young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the peon was not available
            then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in
            his writings as "No peon, No Water". He was required to sit on a
            gunny sack which he had to take home with him. Ramji Sakpal retired
            in 1894 and the family moved to Satara two years later. Shortly
            after their move, Ambedkar's mother died. The children were cared
            for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult circumstances.
            Three sons Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao and two daughters Manjula
            and Tulasa of the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and
            sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high
            school. His original surname was Sakpal but his father registered
            his name as Ambadawekar in school, meaning he comes from his native
            village 'Ambadawe' in Ratnagiri district. His Marathi Brahmin
            teacher, Krishnaji Keshav Ambedkar, changed his surname from
            'Ambadawekar' to his own surname 'Ambedkar' in school records.
