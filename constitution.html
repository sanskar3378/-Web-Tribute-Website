            Upon India's independence on 15 August 1947, the new prime minister
            Jawaharlal Nehru invited Ambedkar to serve as the Dominion of
            India's Law Minister; two weeks later, he was appointed Chairman of
            the Drafting Committee of the Constitution for the future Republic
            of India. On 25 November 1949, Ambedkar in his concluding speech in
            constituent assembly said:[68] "The credit that is given to me does
            not really belong to me. It belongs partly to Sir B.N. Rau the
            Constitutional Advisor to the Constituent Assembly who prepared a
            rough draft of the Constitution for the consideration of the
            Drafting Committee." Indian constitution guarantees and protections
            for a wide range of civil liberties for individual citizens,
            including freedom of religion, the abolition of untouchability, and
            the outlawing of all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar was one of
            the ministers who argued for extensive economic and social rights
            for women, and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system
            of reservations of jobs in the civil services, schools and colleges
            for members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and Other
            Backward Class, a system akin to affirmative action. India's
            lawmakers hoped to eradicate the socio-economic inequalities and
            lack of opportunities for India's depressed classes through these
            measures.[69] The Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949 by
            the Constituent Assembly.[70] Ambedkar expressed his disapproval for
            the constitution in 1953 during a parliament session and said
            "People always keep on saying to me "Oh you are the maker of the
            constitution". My answer is I was a hack. What I was asked to do, I
            did much against my will." Ambedkar added that, "I am quite prepared
            to say that I shall be the first person to burn it out. I do not
            want it. It does not suit anybody."[71][72]
